                                        Vegetable Tikka Masala was rich, flavorful, and perfectly spiced, and the naan
                                        was soft and warm—just the way I like it. I also ordered the Hibiscus Iced Tea,
                                        and it was so refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The atmosphere
                                        was cozy, and the staff was super friendly. Definitely coming back to try the
                                        Vegetarian Paella next time!</p>

                                    <p class="yelp">I had the Spinach and Feta Spanakopita, and it was absolutely
                                        delicious—flaky, buttery, and full of flavor. My friend got the Greek Orzo
                                        Salad, and she raved about how fresh and zesty it was. The only downside is that
                                        the portions were a little small for the price, but the quality of the food was
                                        excellent.</p>

                                    <p class="yelp">As someone who usually eats meat, I was skeptical about a fully
                                        vegetarian restaurant, but The Leafy Spoon changed my mind! The Mushroom
                                        Stroganoff was rich, creamy, and so satisfying—I didn’t even miss the meat. My
                                        partner had the Vegetarian Shepherd’s Pie, and it was warm, comforting, and
                                        packed with flavor. We ended the meal with a Matcha Latte, and it was the
                                        perfect finish. Highly recommend!</p>

                                        the outside and soft on the inside. The Mexican Street Corn Salad had the
                                        perfect blend of charred corn, cotija cheese, and lime. And the Spiced Apple
                                        Cider? Oh my goodness—like fall in a cup! Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and

                                        paired with marinara. The Ratatouille was beautifully plated and tasted fresh
                                        and savory. However, the prices were a bit higher than expected for a vegetarian
                                        spot. The Tropical Mango Smoothie was creamy and delicious, but for the price, I
                                        expected a larger portion. Still, the quality of the food is top-notch, so I’d
                                        come back for a special treat.</p>

                                    <p class="yelp">The food at The Leafy Spoon is fantastic, but the service was a bit
                                        slow. I ordered the Mushroom Stroganoff, and it was creamy and full of flavor.
                                        The Carrot Ginger Soup had a lovely balance of sweetness and spice. However, it
                                        took nearly 30 minutes to get my food, which was a bit frustrating. If they
                                        speed up their service, this place would be perfect!</p>

                                        <p class="yelp">If you’re looking for a vegetarian spot with gourmet flavors,
                                            this
                                            is it! I had the Falafel Bites with Tzatziki, and they were perfectly crisp
                                            on
                                            the outside and soft on the inside. The Mexican Street Corn Salad had the
                                            perfect blend of charred corn, cotija cheese, and lime. And the Spiced Apple
                                            Cider? Oh my goodness—like fall in a cup! Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff,
                                            and
                                            an incredible menu. Highly recommend!</p>

                                        <p style="color: #A4BF20">"Delicious, But Pricey"</p>
                                        <p class="yelp">I loved the Baked Zucchini Fries—crispy, flavorful, and
                                            perfectly
                                            paired with marinara. The Ratatouille was beautifully plated and tasted
                                            fresh
                                            and savory. However, the prices were a bit higher than expected for a
                                            vegetarian
                                            spot. The Tropical Mango Smoothie was creamy and delicious, but for the
                                            price, I
                                            expected a larger portion. Still, the quality of the food is top-notch, so
                                            I’d
                                            come back for a special treat.</p>

                                        <p class="yelp">The food at The Leafy Spoon is fantastic, but the service was a
                                            bit
                                            slow. I ordered the Mushroom Stroganoff, and it was creamy and full of
                                            flavor.
                                            The Carrot Ginger Soup had a lovely balance of sweetness and spice. However,
                                            it
                                            took nearly 30 minutes to get my food, which was a bit frustrating. If they
                                            speed up their service, this place would be perfect!</p>
